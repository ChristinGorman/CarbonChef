This will at some point be an Oven control system for curing composites without having industrial size/strength autoclaves/ovens available.
Initially we'll use an arduino to read temperature profiles from an SD card, (target temperatures, ramp rates and dwell times)
Then turn on the oven and measure the oven/part temperature using this thermocouple https://www.sparkfun.com/products/307,
making sure the temperature curve follows the desired temp profile by turning the oven fan on and off again.
Will hopefully add an android app as a GUI at some point.
Haven't started yet, so can't provide a very useful readme at this point :)
